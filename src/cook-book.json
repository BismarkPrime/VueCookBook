Whisk in the flour and stir until the mixture pulls away from the sides into a glossy ball. Remove from heat. Add 1 egg to the mixture and stir with a wooden spoon until completely combined, then repeat with each egg, not moving onto the next egg until the previous egg is completely mixed. It may be on the thin side, more like a batter, but just let the dough just hang out for about 15-20 minutes (and even if it stays thin, it will work just fine.) You can also do this step using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.  Pour about 3″ of oil into a large skillet, pot, or Dutch Oven. Heat the oil over medium heat to 325 degrees F (use a candy or instant read thermometer to keep the temperature in check.)  Preheat oven to the lowest setting.\n\tWhile the oil is heating, whisk together the sugar, cinnamon, and salt (if desired) in a pie plate.  When the oil is almost ready, transfer the dough to a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip (like open 1M or larger). Squeeze about 3″ of dough into the hot oil and repeat, not crowding the pan (you’ll have to fry the churros in a few batches). Cook for about 3-4 minutes on one side or until golden brown, then flip and continue cooking another 2-3 minutes on the other side (or until the other side is also golden brown.) Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and place the plate in the oven. Repeat frying until the dough is gone.  When all the churros have been cooked, toss them in the cinnamon-sugar mix and serve immediately. Makes about 24 3″ churros. If desired, serve with dark chocolate ganache for dipping."
